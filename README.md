## üöÄ **About Me**:

My name is Samuel Ou and I am a graduate from Stony Brook University and Flatiron Bootcamp

As a developer, I specialize in solving technical problems, finding the most creative and efficient solutions that also provide valuable learning experiences. My passion lies in constant learning and growing my craftsmanship in software.

"What single accomplishment are you most proud of?"
I'm most proud of my growth as a person. When I was younger, I used to be quite hot-headed and stubborn, which often led to conflicts between me and my peers. Fortunately, I was able to turn myself around, but this accomplishment was not a solo accomplishment; surrounding myself with the right people is what pushed me to become more open-minded and patient. These traits branched out into every aspect of my life, whether it was talking to friends/strangers or finding solutions to fix my code. I'm proud of who I've become and am excited to keep growing.

Fun fact about me: After years of playing pool, I successfully learned how to juggle.
