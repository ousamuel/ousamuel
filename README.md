## 🚀 **About Me**:

I'm passionate about web development and am currently pursuing a career in software engineering. With proficiency in a range of technologies like JavaScript, React, Next.js, and Python, I'm equipped to contribute effectively to diverse projects. My experiences as an EMT and medical assistant at Stony Brook University refined my decision-making skills and adaptability in high-pressure situations. The allure of math, physics, and logic prompted me to undertake an intensive 15-week software engineering program. Now, having completed this rigorous training, I'm eager to hone my skills further and collaborate on innovative projects.

For collaborations, inquiries, or just a chat about tech, feel free to contact me!
